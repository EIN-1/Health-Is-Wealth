### Wireframes
![home page](assets/readme-img/Balsamiq-wireframe.png)

The wireframes for `Health is wealth` were produced in <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/s1zt7dl/p9ow423/r18E1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balsamiq</a>. There are frames for a website display and a small mobile device. The final site is slightly different from the wireframes due to developments, I made an effort to maintain consistency with but the final site display.

### Site Structure

### Design Choices

#### Typography
* The fonts chosen for the "Health is Wealth" project are 'Noto Serif' for body text and 'Oswald' for headings. They fall back to serif and sans-serif respectively if unavailable.

    * 'Noto Serif' is used for the body text, providing a classic and readable design that conveys a sense of approachability and professionalism to users.

    * 'Oswald' is selected for headings to create a strong, modern contrast with the body text. Its structured sans-serif style enhances the clarity and focus of key information.

    These fonts together establish a balanced and inviting aesthetic, aligning with the welcoming ethos of our fitness community.


#### Colour Scheme
