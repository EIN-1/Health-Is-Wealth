# Features

## Design
![home page](assets/readme-img/Balsamiq-wireframe.png)

The wireframes for `Health is wealth` were produced in <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/s1zt7dl/p9ow423/r18E1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balsamiq</a>. There are frames for a website display and a small mobile device. The final site is slightly different from the wireframes due to developments but I tired to keep in as the final site display.

## Navigation Bar
![Navigation Bar](assets/readme-img/header.png)
Navigation bar is my `header` which is easily accessed on all pages and it includes:
* The `Logo` in the left corner which states the clear meaning of the page. 
* The `linked pages` on the right includes the `home, offer and contact` and for user interface every current page the user is on, it's link is underlined.
