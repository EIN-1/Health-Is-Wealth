The wireframes for `Health is wealth` were produced in <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/s1zt7dl/p9ow423/r18E1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balsamiq</a>.

## Site Structure
The **Health is Wealth** website consists of four main pages:

- **Offers**: Details the various workout activities available.
- **About Us**: Provides insights into our mission, story, and community.

## Design Choices

### Typography
* The fonts chosen for the "Health is Wealth" project are 'Noto Serif' for body text and 'Oswald' for headings. They fall back to serif and sans-serif respectively if unavailable.

    * 'Noto Serif' is used for the body text, providing a classic and readable design that conveys a sense of approachability and professionalism to users.

    * 'Oswald' is selected for headings to create a strong, modern contrast with the body text. Its structured sans-serif style enhances the clarity and focus of key information.

    These fonts together establish a balanced and inviting aesthetic, aligning with the welcoming ethos of our fitness community.


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the **`Health is Wealth`**  project is centered around a vibrant palette that reflects energy, balance, and vitality. It includes the following colors:

![Colour Palette image](assets/readme-img/colors.png)
- **#5A0D5A**: A deep and rich purple, symbolizing luxury and creativity, serving as a primary accent color for key elements.
- **#A8DD67**: A fresh green hue, representing health, growth, and renewal, fitting perfectly with the workout and wellness theme.
- **#C0C2AE**: A soft neutral tone that complements other colors, offering balance and a sense of calm.
- **#851285**: A bold magenta shade, adding energy and warmth, helping to highlight important information.
- **#F5F5F5**: An off-white, clean background color that enhances readability and contrasts well with darker text.
- **#000000**: Pure black, used for text and essential elements, ensuring clarity and strong contrast.

This color palette aligns with the ethos of our community, promoting a sense of enthusiasm and inclusiveness.
